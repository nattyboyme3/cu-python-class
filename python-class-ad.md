## Why Python?

Python (the programming language) is a **simple** but **powerful** tool, with easy-to-learn syntax and a wide variety of available pre-written libraries. If you use a computer for your job, Python can help you automate repetitive tasks, and do more with your data. 

If you already use Excel, learning Python can open a whole new world of possibilities for how you can use, transform, and understand the data you already use every day. 

## No Experience Required
Not a programmer? Not a Parseltongue? No problem! We'll start simple and build on what you already know.
